Sandwich
========

Sandwich is a cross-platform C sandwich procurement program, its novel approach to sandwiches and what can be considered a sandwich will push the boundaries.
Help is vastly appreciated as I'm not all that great at ASCII art.


Purpose
=======

To provide an native experience for the procurement of textual sandwiches on a vast number of GNU/Linux, BSD, and other UNIX distributions.

Milestones
==========

Sandwich hopes to make a first major release on the birthday of Edward Montagu, first Earl of Sandwich, with relevant native art for at least two major GNU/Linux distributions.

Current Progress
================

As of yet we only have a placeholder piece, other ASCII art is under development, but we need help with a number of things:
 * An ASCII art BLT to represent Fedora(from a bird's-eye view), freenode/#fedora-social endorses the BLT as a representative of Fedora, contact me if you are in conflict with this.
 * Suggestions and reference imagery for sandwiches

Currently, only two distribution communities have treated me with some seriousness and suggested sandwiches.
Fedora, as mentioned reckons BLTs are the way to go, OpenSUSE prefers a rather interesting take on the concept of a cucumber sandwich. (See http://compucrunch.com/assorted/opensusesandwich.jpg)
